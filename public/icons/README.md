# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 px (toolbar)
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 px (toolbar retina)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 px (extension management)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 px (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions. The build process will copy them to the `dist/` folder.

## Design Guidelines

- Use simple, recognizable iconography
- Maintain consistency across sizes
- Ensure visibility on light and dark backgrounds
- Consider the OpenFillIQ brand (form + intelligence concept)
