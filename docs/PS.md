## Problem Statement

People repeatedly enter the same personal information across thousands of websites every day. Newsletter sign-ups, booking systems, job applications, event registrations, support forms. nearly all of them require users to manually type basic details like name, email, phone number, and address.

Despite browser autofill features, the experience is inconsistent. Every site structures forms differently, uses non-standard labels, dynamic fields, or custom widgets. This breaks traditional autofill and forces users to re-enter data again and again. The friction grows worse on mobile and on forms with many fields.

Companies like Greenhouse have solved this problem in narrow domains by offering one-click application autofill. But users still lack a single, unified way to fill any form on the internet with one action, regardless of the website or form structure.

There is no universal, trustworthy, cross-site form-filling system that works like SSO. something a user can click once and instantly populate any form using their stored profile. As a result, users waste time, introduce errors, abandon forms, and face unnecessary friction across the web.

The problem is simple. The web has millions of forms, but no universal, intelligent, domain-agnostic way to fill them fast and accurately.
